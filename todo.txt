TODO:

-LDR data hazard stall
-BL data hazard (next)

-pre/post index writeback ()

-clean controlpath/datapath messiness (ex: ctrl[`WRITE_REG_EN])

-for PC: check for writes to PC (r15), route to PC local variable



Testing:
  1. write assembly by hand
  2. use gcc frontend to assemble
  3. objdump to debug
  4. initial block or readmemh() to initialize hardware
  5. debug port

NEVER SYNTHESIZE a latch
  - check in synthesis log

Fix/Debug ALU (especially conditions codes)

BUG:
- forwarding data that doesn't pass condition
- memory latency hazard (i.e., write, then immediate read) (fixed???)
- branch to pc == 0 causes forced non-noop
