TODO:

-for PC: check for writes to PC (r15), route to PC local variable

Testing:
  1. write assembly by hand
  2. use gcc frontend to assemble
  3. objdump to debug
  4. initial block or readmemh() to initialize hardware
  5. debug port

NEVER SYNTHESIZE a latch
  - check in synthesis log

Implement Load/Store Instructions
  - pre/post base register indexing?
  - how to test?

Fix/Debug ALU (especially conditions codes)
